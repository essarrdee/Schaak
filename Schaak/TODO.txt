~ Optional:
  ~ Option to set custom value system for pieces to guide them in deciding which exchanges are "fair"?
  ~ Sacrificing pawns to get spells?
  ~ Upgrades to cooldown times, % chance of attack nullification?
  ~ Heightmap with extra move costs uphill?
  ~ Interface polish:
    ~ Allow fullscreen switching?
    ~ Allow starting fullscreen to avoid problems on 1024x768 screens


Minor:
* TODO colour according to cover in a colourblind-friendly way, in void Board::updateBoardColour(unsigned int x, unsigned int y)
* TODO make windowSize a public get, only Interface needs to write to it, in Interface
* TODO bug in board drawing, some offsets produce unequal row/column sizes. Fix by restricting board sprite position to integers?
